### Solution Approach
This problem involves reducing a string by repeatedly removing the substrings "AB" or "CD" whenever they appear. The goal is to find the minimum possible length of the string after all such removals.

### Approach
Use a stack to simulate the removals:
- Push characters onto the stack.
- If "A" is followed by "B" or "C" is followed by "D", remove them (pop from the stack).
- After processing the string, the size of the stack will be the minimum length of the string.

### Time complexity:
- O(n)

### Space complexity:
- O(n)
